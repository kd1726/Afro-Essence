<h3> Ghana</h3>
<p> Today we go these two beautiful ladies rocking some fire dresses. Today were give some attention to the fashion brand named "Klor-Tsoo-Okai". This type of dress shows the feminity as well as confidence and power of this woman. In addition to the beautiful dress that this woman is wearing, this model's natural beauty also supersedes what you see in this image. The woman with the shorter dress really has a show of showing her beauty, power, and feminity with her pose, aura, and to be frank her physique. I've got to keep it real she is absolutelty stunning. </p>
<p>Next up is the gorgeous woman with the long dress. It has a tradidtional feel to it. Like the first image, it shows feminity, however, it exudes more kindness and shyness than confidence and power. However, it still a beautiful dress that is and should be worn by a beatiful, elegant, and sensational queen. Let's also not forgot to mention her hair, smile, and posture. She is representing the epitome of femininity.</p>

<h3>Senegal</h3>
<p>Look at Khoudia Diop killing it again with the dark skin and elegant enitre as usual. Her extra melanated skin along with an outpouring of self love and reverence basically allows her to kill the game at all times. Now instead of gasing her up as a dark skin icon, lets actually talk about her style. It looks very beautiful. The way she wears the outfit makes her seem as if she is the epitome of quintessential elements and elegance of senegalese fashion. Everything from the earings, to the beads, to the head wrap. Very much indigenous and the very personification of elegance. As always, you are beautiful.</p>
<p> I don't know who the woman to the left is, however, she made it on to this blog, so guess what? We gone gas her up too. GOD DAMN WOMAN! God definitely didn't make a mistake with you. Make no mistake god carefully used it's paint brush to make all of y'all beautiful, alluring and..just sexy. The make up is on point, the hair is beautiful, but i do wish it had that orginal kinkyness. Her face is also just...LAWD have mercy. She is so fine is the most subtle way posible. This woman is different in the sense that her beautiful is more subtle than it is radiating outward. However, like all of the women on this page, her beauty is ever present. You go girl!</p>

<h3>Nigeria</h3>
<p> So as usual Nigeria also killing the game right now with fashion and style. Today we are blessed enough to be able to witness these two beautifuk, alluring melanated women. It's really moments like these that really make us stop and thank god that we woke up today. Otherwise we would be able to bless our eyes with these two goddesses. First, we gotta take about the beautiful woman on the left with the orange dress. The pattern and design is amaing. The length in my opinion really draws out her femininity. The skin and hair also makes me see her as a blessing to this world as well as to her family members and boyfriend (if you got one). The shades are a nice touch. Nigeria really knows how to use the right models for the right type of cloths. Really nice!</p>
<p>Now, let us discuss the curly haired beautiy on the left. The style personally isn't really my style, but the model herself is. She is absolutely beautiful and I feel that she could totally slay a more flashy outfit. Basically if she wore what the woman on the left ware, she would absolutely kill it. However dispite me not really liking the fit, she is still a beautiful woman and a blessing to the earth. You go girl!</p>

<h3 class="specialfeature"> Special Feature</h3>
<p class = "specialfeature"> Y'all forgot there was finna be a special feature? Today's special feature is a ghanaian named Naana. She also happens to be my girlfriend and wife to be. I used this picture of her to show that she is in fact the biggest blessing to earth than the angels themselves. She is an amazing person with so much drive and inner strength. This dress she is wearing and the makeup she has on is the personification of African beauty. The lip stick is so elegant and subtly sexy. The enitre photo is very very sensual without giving off too much sexiness. It's like a dark skin aphrodite incarnate. Thr hair and everything about her looks as if god used a very very special paint brush to create this goddess. I am so lucky to have her as my girlfirend and wife to be. Lastly it is secy without showing too much. It id the epitome and quintessence of beauty and sensuality. </p>

<pre> 
         The sun rays bounce off her skin for all to see
         
         how one can radiate so beautifully 

         with skin to take the power of the star
        
         why would one not want to shine much so far
