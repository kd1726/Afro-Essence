<h3> The Kente</h3>
<p> The kente of Ghana is a vibrant pattern. It usually has a large array of colors. The patterns a mesmirizing and the style is absolutely beautiful. In addition it can go with both  males and females. The fabric used to create the kente also has a really nice texture. I know this because me myself comes from ghana(through my parents). If you wanna know more about the kente or ghanaian fahsion styles in general, click fashion styles. If you want to know the cultural significance and how it came to prominence, click fashion culture. This particular type of kente with this is usually used for formal events. But now awdays it is used for regular fashion. </p>
